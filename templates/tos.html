            <p>Welcome to The Social Sort. By creating an account and using our platform, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using the service, you confirm your agreement to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the service.</p>

            <h2>2. User Accounts and Data</h2>
            <p>To participate in the voting system, you must create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Data Integrity and Deletion Policy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> Our service is built upon an Elo rating system that requires a persistent and historical dataset of user interactions (votes) to function accurately. Each vote contributes to the ranking and profile of all users involved.</li>
                <li><strong>No Deletion of Account Data:</strong> By signing up, you acknowledge and agree that your user profile, including your username and voting history, becomes an integral part of this dataset. <strong>Once an account is created and votes are cast, the associated data cannot be deleted upon request.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Why?:</strong> Removing a user's data would retroactively invalidate the ratings of every other user they have interacted with, compromising the integrity and fairness of the entire system. Your participation is a permanent contribution to the platform's data structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>You agree not to use the service to post or transmit any material which is defamatory, offensive, or of an obscene or menacing character, or which may, in our judgment, cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to any person.</p>

            <h2>5. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page. Your continued use of the service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
