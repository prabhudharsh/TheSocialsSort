        <div class="content">
            <p class="intro">We are a constellation, each name a star seen in a different light. Some shine for their brilliance, others for their warmth. This is a place to see the patterns we form and the lines that are drawn between us.</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>The Social Sort was born from a simple idea: social dynamics are complex, beautiful, and often unspoken. We wanted to create a platform that brings these hidden connections to light in a fun and engaging way. By using a sophisticated Elo rating system—the same kind used to rank chess masters—we turn subjective opinions into a dynamic, ever-evolving map of a social group.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Every vote you cast is more than just a choice; it's a piece of data that helps refine the social fabric. When you choose one person over another in a specific category, you're not just stating a preference. You're contributing to a system that learns and adapts, revealing who we are through the eyes of our peers. It’s a mirror held up to the group, reflecting everything from the class clown to the kindest soul.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>We are committed to creating a respectful and enjoyable experience. The data generated here is a collective story, and we believe in protecting the integrity of that story. We hope you enjoy exploring the unique constellation of your social world.</p>
